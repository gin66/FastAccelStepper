  and then start the queue. If several motor are started one after the other
  (with interrupts disabled), a nearly synchronous start is possible.
  Which is required for coordinated axis movement
- make use of this in enqueueing commands from ramp generator

- update FastAccelStepper.h: stopMove() does not make new acceleration value valid
- protect non application fields, which are for test purposes

0.17.1:
- esp32: Fixed one/two spurious step pulses after reset mainly (issue #29)
- avr: reworked ISR for more reliable operation (correct steps). (issue #31)
  Remaining risk (primarily three steppers in parallel in 2560) can cause
  an CPU overload and stepper stopping/not running smooth
- Fix issue #32
- Remove interrupts/noInterrupts protection for shared auto enable function.

- Reworked the avr ISR code to avoid steps being lost, if the command queue is running out of commands and a new command comes in with steps to be generated
- Extended the planning ahead time to 20ms.... possibly the load for avr is bit high !? 

0.16.5:
- esp32: forwardStep()/backwardStep() works again
- Fix for issue #25: RampGenerator was irritated, if interrupt has processed command too fast.
- Rework definition of isRunning() for esp32 to make it more like avr

0.16.4:

0.15.2:
- Assume for now, that atmega328 and ATmega2560 uses always same pins for OC1A and OC1B

0.15.1:
- Remove the check for specific avr board. This assumes, that all avr boards
  uses Pin 9 and Pin 10 for OC1A and OC1B respectively

0.15.0:
- For the commands in the queue, the minimum time in ticks to execute
  a command is limited to 10 * `MIN_DELTA_TICKS`. For esp32 this relates to
  the time between interrupts of one channel
- `AQE_ERROR_TICKS_TOO_HIGH` removed, because it is already limited by the data type `uint16_t`
- esp32: Change from mcpwm up count mode to up-down count mode

- esp32: Cyclic rate increased from 10ms to 4ms.
	With a planning ahead time of 10ms, there was the risk
	of running out of commands as identified in issue #18

0.13.2:
- StepperDemo: Compact output for stopped motor
- Fixed a bug, where stepper 4-6 misconfigured stepper 1-3 pcnt.
	=> stepper 4-6 had erroneous behavior for speed <500us
    => stepper 1-3 could in trouble, if corresponding stepper 4-6 was running

0.13.1:
- try a mechanism to include application defined config file
- StepperDemo: for avr move messages into program code to reduce RAM usage

  This allows approx. 60/120 ms delay for avr/esp32
- esp32: two motors in parallel could lead to uncontrolled running steppers.
         Reason was the wrong registration of the shared interrupt service routine

0.11.1:
- AVR works again
- Limit auto enable on delay to approx. 16ms due to further bugs

0.11.0:
- BROKEN ON AVR
- Slowest speed is `TICKS_PER_S`/0xffffffff, which is ~268s between steps
- `ABS_MAX_TICKS` renamed to `ABS_MAX_AQE_TICKS`. Only applicable to raw commands

- StepperDemo extended:
	- blocking wait for stepper stop by press W (dangerous: can deadlock)

0.9.3:
- Fix auto on delay: Delay way always replied, even if the output is still enabled

0.9.2:
- Implement new function applySpeedAcceleration()
- StepperDemo extended:
	- trigger applySpeedAcceleration by press U
- fix possible bug in move/moveTo while keepRunning is set

0.9.1:
- reduce interrupt load on esp32

0.9.0:
- implement forceStopAndNewPosition()
- StepperDemo extended:
	- trigger forceStopAndNewPosition by press X
    - set position with press @
    - keep motor running with press K
- addQueueEntry() returns now an `int8_t` instead of an int
- move and moveTo goes to the closest position (+/-2147483647).
  This means continues move(1000) will let the stepper turn in same direction,
  while the position wraps around: 0,1,...,2147483647,-2147483648,-2147483647,...,-1,0,1,...
- add keepRunning() to let the motor continuously run in same direction.
- rename isrSpeedControlEnabled() to isRampGeneratorActive()

0.8.3:
- AVR: timer compare interrupts are only enabled, if stepper is running.
- AVR: on arrival of a command, the queue is started with few Âµs delay
- Implement backwardStep() and forwardStep()
- Bug solved: Speed changes at very low speed with high acceleration values are not always performed
  Actually speed with period times > 268436Âµs has not worked at all before.

0.8.2:
- Solved issue: Queue is filled too much, which cause slow response to speed/acceleration changes
  => Queue is filled to max ~10ms into the future.

0.8.1:
- Fix issue #8: Long step times are less accurate than short ones
  => All time delta between steps are cycle accurate
- Add getPeriodAfterCommandsCompleted() to API
- Fix bug due to AutoEnable at ramp start (can find at low speeds)
- StepperDemo outputs: `F_CPU`/`TICKS_PER_S` and stepper period at queue end

0.8.0:
- Change direction with running motor is possible !!!
- stopMove() can be called from interrupt routine
- Refactor ramp generation code into RampGenerator.h/cpp
- StepperDemo: ramp state is written as plain text
- Mention platformio in README

0.7.1:
- StepperDemo extended with commands to 
		return status code from move/moveTo
		toggle motor info (I) to suppress info while steppers are running
		output usage (?)
		output motor info with usage
		test direct drive of stepper by port manipulation bypassing the library (T)
- move/moveTo return error codes

0.7.0: Changes towards 0.6.15
- Fix possible floating point exception (divide by zero), which could happen rarely in `isr_single_fill_queue`
- Remove deprecated functions:
	addQueueStepperStop()
    isStopped()
- internal: remove obsolete `_stepper_num variable`
