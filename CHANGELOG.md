  which requires short acceleration
- StepperDemo extended:
	- command u to put selected stepper into unidirectional mode (need reset to restore)
- Fix for issue #47: Restart in unidirectional mode and position count down
- addQueueEntry returns AQE_ERROR_NO_DIR_PIN_TO_TOGGLE, if command defines count down and direction pin is undefined

  the externalEnableCall was cleared even if enablePinLowActive still in use.
- Bugfix for issue #46: Avoid creation of invalid command in ramp generator while decelerating

0.20.1:

0.18.11:
- Remove obsolete queue_end variables ticks and ticks_from_last_step
- Fix for issue #33: pulse counter needed to be cleared at motor start

0.18.10:

  opposite direction due to two missing initialization, which are
  present for move/moveTo

0.18.5
- replace 16bit division with upm_float division
- ramp generator packs per command steps for 2 ms or more. 
  Before this was 1ms. This change makes huge difference on Atmega2560

0.18.4:
- avr: Step ISR code optimization e.g. get rid of digitalRead/Write
- esp32: get rid of digitalRead/Write, too
- replave 32bit division with 16bit => much better timing on avr

0.18.3:
- esp32: extend API to attach free pulse counter for debugging
- StepperDemo extended for esp32:
	- p<n>: Attach pulse counter n to the selected stepper

0.18.2:
- extend addQueueEntry() with a start flag. This allows to first fill the queue
  and then start the queue. If several motor are started one after the other
  (with interrupts disabled), a nearly synchronous start is possible.
  Which is required for coordinated axis movement
- make use of this in enqueueing commands from ramp generator

0.18.1:
- moveByAcceleration() returns int8_t result code
- setDelayToEnable() returns an int8_t instead of int

0.18.0:
- StepperDemo extended:
	- w<ms>: Option to wait in input processing for some ms
	- test sequence 07 added, which fails on esp32
	- avr: free RAM by usage of output_msg()

  some irregularity between steps.
- Rework esp32 interrupt code.
- Fix issue #29 and a slow start of a ramp (identified by #29)
- RampGenerator: Support coasting at lower speed for a couple of steps
  to limit interrupt rate for esp32 (or even rejected commands)

- fixed: In reversing at max speed an abrupt stop could be initiated
- update FastAccelStepper.h: stopMove() does not make new acceleration value valid
- protect non application fields, which are for test purposes

0.17.1:
- esp32: Fixed one/two spurious step pulses after reset mainly (issue #29)
- avr: reworked ISR for more reliable operation (correct steps). (issue #31)
  Remaining risk (primarily three steppers in parallel in 2560) can cause
  an CPU overload and stepper stopping/not running smooth
- Fix issue #32
- Remove interrupts/noInterrupts protection for shared auto enable function.
  => Thus there is a small time window during auto disable, that a new command issued
     may loose steps. This will be addressed in a subsequent release

0.17.0:
- avr: stepper definition support via AVRStepperPins.h
- 2560: all timers and channels are checked with one test
- addQueueEntry(): remove test for steps >= 128

- Use simavr to perform regression test for avr on HW-simulation
- Reworked the avr ISR code to avoid steps being lost, if the command queue is running out of commands and a new command comes in with steps to be generated
- Extended the planning ahead time to 20ms.... possibly the load for avr is bit high !? 

0.16.5:
- esp32: forwardStep()/backwardStep() works again
- Fix for issue #25: RampGenerator was irritated, if interrupt has processed command too fast.
- Rework definition of isRunning() for esp32 to make it more like avr

0.16.4:
- Example code for platformio (built with ci/build-platformio.sh) references the library code
  via platformio.ini option and not via symbolic links.
- StepperDemo test mode extended:
	- x: Allows to exit test mode
    - I: Allows to toggle motor info while test sequence is running
    - New test sequence 06 due to issue #24
- Fix for issue #24: unplanned stop due to speed changes during ramp down

0.16.3:
- Add another test case for speed reduction, while running (see issue #23)
  This has identified a bug in the ramp generator impacting esp32/avr. This bug is now fixed.

0.16.2:
- Add comments to example RawAccessWithPause (renamed from RawAccessWithDelay)
- addQueueEntry() expects now a const pointer instead of just a pointer
- Rework RawAccess example and test on hw

0.16.1:
- Usage example in readme has not worked due to a bug in the auto enable/disable variable setting.
  => Added the UsageExample under examples

0.16.0:
- disableOutputs() returns boolean success value
- The external enable output routine will be called regularly in case of disable, too
- esp32: fixed loss of pauses in command queue due to pcnt/mcpwm timer interaction.
   This caused V4100 being faster than V4000, even so it should be slower
- ramp generator: fix for high accelerations to have stop command effective

0.15.2:
- Assume for now, that atmega328 and ATmega2560 uses always same pins for OC1A and OC1B

0.15.1:
- Remove the check for specific avr board. This assumes, that all avr boards
  uses Pin 9 and Pin 10 for OC1A and OC1B respectively

0.15.0:
- For the commands in the queue, the minimum time in ticks to execute
  a command is limited to 10*MIN_DELTA_TICKS. For esp32 this relates to
  the time between interrupts of one channel
- AQE_ERROR_TICKS_TOO_HIGH removed, because it is already limited by the data type uint16_t
- esp32: Change from mcpwm up count mode to up-down count mode
- avr: adjust implementation to esp32: pulse at start of ticks period of a command
- merge pull request from ixil see (https://github.com/gin66/FastAccelStepper/pull/19)

0.13.4:
- Automated github test identified a compile error introduced in 0.13.3

0.13.3:
- esp32: Cyclic rate increased from 10ms to 4ms.
	With a planning ahead time of 10ms, there was the risk
	of running out of commands as identified in issue #18

0.13.2:
- StepperDemo: Compact output for stopped motor
- Fixed a bug, where stepper 4-6 misconfigured stepper 1-3 pcnt.
	=> stepper 4-6 had erroneous behavior for speed <500us
    => stepper 1-3 could in trouble, if corresponding stepper 4-6 was running

0.13.1:
- try a mechanism to include application defined config file
- StepperDemo: for avr move messages into program code to reduce RAM usage

- Support ATmega2560 for three steppers linked to timer 4 (currently hardcoded)

0.12.2:
- StepperDemo modification:
    - Enable direct drive feature in StepperDemo for esp32
    - While direct driving, check if the signals can be applied
    - Add test mode (enter with t). Here can select stepper, a test sequence and run it
    - In total four test sequences implemented until now
- Add detachFromPin() and reattachToPin() to the API. Shouldn't be used from an application.

0.12.1:
- implement runForward()/runBackward()
- avr: fix interrupt for direction change
- StepperDemo modification:
    - r: Call ESP.restart() to check for issue #6

0.12.0:

   => remove ABS_MAX_AQE_TICKS
- each command in queue can now emit up to 255 steps
- StepperDemo modification:
    - r: Call ESP.restart() to check for issue #6
    - Disable direct drive for esp32
- AutoEnable-Pin can be shared by steppers
- avr: fix interrupt for direction change

0.11.3:
- ABSOLUTE_MAX_AQE_TICKS is now 65535

0.11.2:
- auto enable on delay implemented by filling the queue with pause
  This allows approx. 60/120 ms delay for avr/esp32
- esp32: two motors in parallel could lead to uncontrolled running steppers.
         Reason was the wrong registration of the shared interrupt service routine

0.11.1:
- AVR works again
- Limit auto enable on delay to approx. 16ms due to further bugs

0.11.0:
- BROKEN ON AVR
- Slowest speed is TICKS_PER_S/0xffffffff, which is ~268s between steps
- ABS_MAX_TICKS renamed to ABS_MAX_AQE_TICKS. Only applicable to raw commands
- Done: Extend command queue entry to perform delay only without step (steps=0) to reduce the 1.0 steps/s

0.10.0:
- setSpeed() silently imposes lower limit for period
- esp32: step pulse length is for high speed with 50% duty cycle and for low speed fixed at 2ms
- addQueueEntry() receives a stepper_command_s struct
- esp32: Task priority of ramp generator task has been set to max Priority.
- StepperDemo extended:
	- Q: Quiet the usage info, which takes time to be transmitted.
      Try this NEMA-17 without load:
			M1 A1000000 V20 P1000 W P0 W P500 W P-500 W P0

- StepperDemo extended:
	- trigger applySpeedAcceleration by press U
- fix possible bug in move/moveTo while keepRunning is set

0.9.1:
- reduce interrupt load on esp32

0.9.0:
- implement forceStopAndNewPosition()
- StepperDemo extended:
	- trigger forceStopAndNewPosition by press X
    - set position with press @
    - keep motor running with press K
- addQueueEntry() returns now an int8_t instead of an int
- move and moveTo goes to the closest position (+/-2147483647).
  This means continues move(1000) will let the stepper turn in same direction,
  while the position wraps around: 0,1,...,2147483647,-2147483648,-2147483647,...,-1,0,1,...
- add keepRunning() to let the motor continuously run in same direction.
- rename isrSpeedControlEnabled() to isRampGeneratorActive()

0.8.3:
- AVR: timer compare interrupts are only enabled, if stepper is running.
- AVR: on arrival of a command, the queue is started with few µs delay
- Implement backwardStep() and forwardStep()
- Bug solved: Speed changes at very low speed with high acceleration values are not always performed
  Actually speed with period times > 268436µs has not worked at all before.

0.8.2:
- Solved issue: Queue is filled too much, which cause slow response to speed/acceleration changes
  => Queue is filled to max ~10ms into the future.

0.8.1:
- Fix issue #8: Long step times are less accurate than short ones
  => All time delta between steps are cycle accurate
- Add getPeriodAfterCommandsCompleted() to API
- Fix bug due to AutoEnable at ramp start (can find at low speeds)
- StepperDemo outputs: F_CPU/TICKS_PER_S and stepper period at queue end

		test direct drive of stepper by port manipulation bypassing the library (T)
- move/moveTo return error codes

0.7.0: Changes towards 0.6.15
- Fix possible floating point exception (divide by zero), which could happen rarely in isr_single_fill_queue
- Remove deprecated functions:
	addQueueStepperStop()
    isStopped()
- internal: remove obsolete _stepper_num variable
