I went through a ton of iterations of trying to make this work sd desired.
It seems quite simple, set the pulse period of the PWM generator, start it,
stop it after e->ticks number of ticks.  Except for that its never easy.

We start with how to detect that e->ticks has happened. I found that
regaurdless of output mode, the PIO device is always connected and receiving
inputs!  This means I can use it to trigger on a pulse being sent!  But this
means I will get an interrupt for every single pulse.  Thats not ideal, and I
wasn't sure this would be able to operate fast enough in this mode.  I
actually did what I could to get into the PWM shutdown as fast as possible.
However, it seems like it would still send one more pulse every time.  It
wouldn't register a full rise on my scope, and it probably....wouldn't have
triggered a pulse on a stepper driver...but probably isn't good enough.  No
matter what I did, I wasn't fast enough.  So I found that using the PIO to
disconnect the output of the pulse generator was nearly instantaneous.  So
fast that to keep the interrupt on a rising edge, I need to delay a few
microseconds to keep from chopping off the pulse!  In fact, my driver says
it needs 5 microsecond pulses.  I'm currently sending 10 microsencond pulses.
With a 5 microsecond delay before shutting off, the pulse is only 7
microseconds in length!  The performance of the code seems quite good!  So
not only is the overhead of the interrupts low enough to chop pulses off,
its good enough to easily manage at least one stepper.  (I need to make code
more generic and make ISRs for the other ports and test with more).

The last "trick" that was necessary was a delay in starting the pulse generator
after setting the direction pin.  Currently my test just spins the motor 1
revolution then spins it the other way.  So every stop needs a delay.  The
delay is 100% necessary for setting the direction pin, so it cannot simply be
removed!

With that, I've spun this motor to about 1600 RPM.  No matter how slow the
acceleration, it seems to stop somewhere just above that.  So the code can do
more than my nema23 test motor :)

Last "trick".  I didn't think about the fact that at 21MHz with a 16 bit
counter, the longest the system can delay is around 3ms.  Fortunately, this was
not lost on the original author.  the hasSteps or steps==0 case is when you
want to pause for a time (specified in the ticks member).  To pause, I can
disconnect the PWM peripheral, and  generate PWM interrupts instead of using
the PIO interrupts.  It may seem like a good idea to just use the PWM
interrupts.  However, this arrangement actually eliminates a branch, and keeps
pause code seprate from pulse code.  On top of that, I get a true count of
pulses output, rather than pulses attempted to be generated even if it was
disconnected.  Its actually more accurate than my scope, as if I am in
process of disconnecting the PWM peripheral, I still get a PIO interrupt, but
on the scope, I see only a small .8-.9V pulse.  Its possible that pulse could
be detected, though not likely.  Better to eliminate it if possible (which it
was!)  The branch is eliminated by not needing to check if it was the cmpr
register interrupt, or the period update interrupt.  The PWM interrupt is
always the period update, and the PIO is always the cmp.  One branch isn't
much, but its something!


I think I'm going about this all wrong.  I think I can set the AB reg to the PWM
generator, but set the output to 0 and still get interrupts on the PIO when a
pulse would have happened if we hadn't overridden the output to 0.  Look into
this...

  // The datasheet is INCREDIBLY confusing here again.  It writes of interrupts

  // that Atmel's tech writers are atrocious.  The PWM unit containts two almost
  // distinct peripherals.  Theres the PWM generator with its 8 channels and
  // individual register and clock selection.  In addition to this, attached to
  // channel 0 only is the "comparison" peripheral.  Even though the main PWM
  // channel registers will compare values against the clock, do not call them
  // comparison registers.  They are Period and Duty cycle registers.  Thats all
  // they can be used for, so don't think of them as "comparison", especially
  // since there are "comparison" registers which are only good for comparison
  // attached to channel 0.  The comparison unit is used to generate "special"
  // interrupts, all controleld by the IXR2 registers (where X can be E, D, M,
  // or S to make up the entire register set).  The fact they are tied to
  // channel 0 is why there is the confusion mention of "synchronous" in the
  // datasheet, despite synchronous being used to mean tying main PWM output
  // channels to the same clock so that either their left sides are aligned or
  // their centers are aligned (depending on a register setting).
  //
  // The IXR1 (again E,D,M,and S) registers are for the main PWM channels
  // only, and do not make use of the comparison unit.  They have 2 possible
  // sources, channel fault, and "clock event" was used because there are two
  // possible modes for the clock to be run in, but in the description, this
  // isn't explained.  It really ought to be called "Period Reset".  Effectively
  // this is what it is whether in left aligned or center aligned modes.  In
  // the timing diagrams on page 980 of the data sheet, its clear that it
  // responds directly to the period register, not the clock itself.  The clock
  // also responds to the period register, so naming of this interrupt/event
  // would make *FAR* more sense to be tied to the register than effects it the
  // most!  So without checking the datasheet, its an interrupt when the period
  // expires.  In center aligned the counter counts up until it matches the
  // period register, then back to 0 to make "one full period".  When it hits 0
  // the "Counter Event" interrupt for the channel "CHIDx" is fired, again,
  // think of it as Period Reset interrupt.  In left Aligned the counter counts
  // up until it reaches the period register and then resets to 0, and fires
  // the "CHIDx" interrupt" (period reset interrupt).  That was way more
  // description than should have been necessary, but I wanted to clear up the
  // nearly worthless datasheet.  It is supposed to be a reference, you're not
  // supposed to need to read the entire thing, correleate all discrepencies,
  // determine the truth, then apply, it should be a reference meaning each
  // section should be able to be read/understood individually.  Intel does a
  // fantastic job of this with IA32 Software Developer's Manual!  Atmel could
  // take a lesson!  Even AMD with Radeon GPU documenation was better than this!

  // Anyhow, this ISR without the complexity of IXR2 registers is actually quite
  // simple.  Figure out which channel had a period reset event, and service it.
  // Since we have to read the entire ISR1 register, we need to make sure we
  // don't have multiple period update events.  It should be rare, but it can
  // happen! Then, because we only use this for pausing, and each pause has one
  // period cycle, we simply advance rp, and decide what to do from there (pause
  // again or switch to outputting steps).  Pretty easy :)
